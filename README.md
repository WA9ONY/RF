# RF: Radio Frequencies

The electromagnetic spectrum is vast, and the radio frequency (RF) portion covers a wide range of both wavelengths and frequencies. Here's a general breakdown:

**Radio Frequency (RF) Portion of the Electromagnetic Spectrum:**

- **Starts:**
  - **Wavelength:** Approximately 100 kilometers (km)
  - **Frequency:** 3 kilohertz (kHz)

- **Ends:**
  - **Wavelength:** Around 1 millimeter (mm)
  - **Frequency:** 300 gigahertz (GHz)

However, it's essential to note that these boundaries are somewhat arbitrary and can vary slightly based on different sources or standards. 

For a more detailed perspective, the radio frequency spectrum is often divided into bands:

1. **Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)**: 3 to 30 Hz
2. **Super Low Frequency (SLF)**: 30 to 300 Hz
3. **Ultra Low Frequency (ULF)**: 300 Hz to 3 kHz
4. **Very Low Frequency (VLF)**: 3 to 30 kHz
5. **Low Frequency (LF)**: 30 to 300 kHz
6. **Medium Frequency (MF)**: 300 kHz to 3 MHz
7. **High Frequency (HF)**: 3 to 30 MHz
8. **Very High Frequency (VHF)**: 30 to 300 MHz
9. **Ultra High Frequency (UHF)**: 300 MHz to 3 GHz
10. **Super High Frequency (SHF)**: 3 to 30 GHz
11. **Extremely High Frequency (EHF)**: 30 to 300 GHz

The terms "radio waves" or "radio frequencies" commonly refer to the entire range from 3 kHz up to 300 GHz. Beyond 300 GHz, we enter the realm of terahertz radiation, infrared, and visible light.

Comparing the two systems allows us to understand the evolution of navigational technology, with both representing significant milestones in the development of global navigation systems before the widespread adoption of satellite-based systems like GPS.


The positional accuracy of these two systems varied based on several factors including the signal quality, environmental conditions, and the technology inherent in the receivers. Here's a general idea of the positional accuracy of both systems:

1. **RSDN-20 (Alpha)**:
   - The positional accuracy of the RSDN-20 system is not documented explicitly in open sources. However, given its technology and the era in which it operated, it can be inferred that it might not have been as accurate as modern GPS systems. It would have been sufficient for submarine and aircraft navigation, offering a reasonable level of accuracy that could potentially be within a few kilometers. 

2. **Omega Navigation System**:
   - The Omega system had a positional accuracy of approximately 4 nautical miles, which is equivalent to about 7.4 kilometers. This level of accuracy was quite good at the time, considering the limitations in technology and the global coverage that the Omega system provided.

In comparison to modern GPS systems, which offer positional accuracies within a few meters, both the RSDN-20 and Omega systems had larger error margins. However, for their time, they were significant achievements in navigation technology, providing vital navigational capabilities for maritime and aerial navigation.

The transmitting power of both the RSDN-20 and the Omega systems was quite significant, capable of transmitting signals over vast distances. Here's an approximate idea of the transmitting power of both systems:

1. **RSDN-20 (Alpha)**:
   - The transmitting power of individual RSDN-20 stations is not well-documented in open sources. However, given the necessity to transmit over large distances, including underwater for submarine navigation, it's likely that the transmitting power was in the range of several hundred kilowatts to a few megawatts.

2. **Omega Navigation System**:
   - The Omega system's transmitting power was considerable, with stations capable of transmitting at power levels up to 10 kW (and possibly more in some stations). This high power output allowed for global coverage, transmitting signals that could be received by vessels and aircraft worldwide.

It's important to note that the information might not be precise due to the limited availability of specific technical data on both systems. These systems were developed during a period when the technical specifications might have been considered sensitive information, hence the exact details might not be publicly available. However, it's safe to infer that both systems utilized high power transmitters capable of facilitating long-range navigation.

The Omega Navigation System utilized eight different frequencies to broadcast signals from its various stations around the world. The specific frequencies were:

1. 10.2 kHz
2. 11.05 kHz
3. 11.33 kHz
4. 13.1 kHz
5. 13.6 kHz
6. 13.8 kHz
7. 14.3 kHz
8. 14.8 kHz

Each of the eight Omega stations transmitted on a unique frequency from the list above, which allowed receivers to differentiate signals coming from different stations and thereby calculate the user's position accurately. The use of multiple frequencies also helped in mitigating the chances of signal interference and allowed for better global coverage.

The Russian Alpha navigation system, also known as RSDN-20, utilizes several transmitting stations across Russia to relay its signals. Each transmission frequency (F1, F2, F3, and F4) might not be tied to a specific individual station, as the frequencies can be part of the broadcast scheme of each station in the network. However, here are the primary stations and their general frequency ranges:

1. **Krasnodar (Anapa) - RSDN-20.1**
   - Frequencies: Generally broadcasts on multiple frequencies including the ones listed as F1 (11.90 kHz), F2, F3, and F4.
   - Coordinates: 44.9966 N, 37.3473 E

2. **Revda (

Ekaterinburg) - RSDN-20.2**
   - Frequencies: This station also uses a range of frequencies which might encompass F1, F2, F3, and F4.
   - Coordinates: 56.7558 N, 59.9306 E

3. **Nizhny Novgorod (Krotovo) - RSDN-20.3**
   - Frequencies: This station broadcasts over several frequencies which potentially include F1 (12.05 kHz), F2, F3, and F4.
   - Coordinates: 56.2167 N, 44.0000 E

4. **Arkhangelsk (Sosnovka) - RSDN-20.4**
   - Frequencies: Responsible for transmissions over various frequencies, potentially including F1, F2 (11.55 kHz), F3, and F4.
   - Coordinates: 64.5422 N, 40.5372 E

Please note that the frequencies (F1, F2, F3, and F4) mentioned here are representative, and the exact frequencies utilized might vary. Moreover, the system might allocate frequencies dynamically, meaning that a single station might be capable of transmitting on multiple frequencies as needed. It would be beneficial to refer to specific technical documentation for precise data.

The Russian Alpha (RSDN-20) navigation system transmits signals in a sequence consisting of four frequencies, commonly designated F1, F2, F3, and F4. Here's the transmission schedule, as per general documentation available:

1. **F1 Transmission (14.88125 kHz)**:
   - Duration: 60 seconds
   - This is followed by a 60-second pause before the next transmission begins.

2. **F2 Transmission (12.64975 kHz)**:
   - Duration: 60 seconds
   - This is followed by a 60-second pause before the next transmission begins.

3. **F3 Transmission (11.90475 kHz)**:
   - Duration: 60 seconds
   - This is followed by a 60-second pause before the next transmission begins.

4. **F4 Transmission (11.64125 kHz)**:
   - Duration: 60 seconds
   - This is followed by a 60-second pause before the sequence restarts with the F1 transmission.

So, the cycle repeats every 8 minutes (4 transmissions x [60 seconds transmission + 60 seconds pause] = 480 seconds or 8 minutes). This cycle ensures a regular and predictable pattern of transmissions, which allows for effective navigation using the system.

Keep in mind that specific details may vary, and for precise technical details, one should refer to official documentation.

The RSDN-20 (Alpha) system operates in the very low frequency (VLF) range. Here are some characteristics of radio propagation at these frequencies:

1. **Ground Wave Propagation**:
   - **Ground Penetration**: Due to the VLF frequencies used, the signals can penetrate seawater to a depth of several meters, making it useful for submarine communications and navigation.
   - **Low Attenuation Over Land**: These VLF waves can follow the curvature of the earth to a certain extent, resulting in lower signal attenuation over long distances when traveling over the ground.

2. **Skywave Propagation**:
   - **Long-Distance Communication**: The signals can also reflect off the ionosphere, allowing for long-distance communication and navigation capabilities, especially at night when the ionosphere is more stable.
   - **Multi-path Interference**: Sometimes, signals can reach the receiver by multiple paths (direct and reflected), causing multi-path interference. This can potentially cause errors in navigation calculations.

3. **Atmospheric and Seasonal Influences**:
   - **Atmospheric Noise**: VLF frequencies can sometimes pick up atmospheric noise from lightning and other natural phenomena.
   - **Seasonal Variations**: The propagation characteristics can vary with seasons, mainly because of the changes in the ionosphere's properties.

4. **Signal Characteristics**:
   - **Narrow Bandwidth**: The VLF band offers a narrow bandwidth, which restricts the data rate that can be transmitted.
   - **Long Wavelength**: The VLF signals have long wavelengths, which means they require substantial antenna structures for transmission.

5. **Antenna Considerations**:
   - **Large Antenna Size**: Transmitting antennas for VLF frequencies are generally large, often taking the form of extensive ground-based antenna fields or antenna arrays.
   - **Complex Ground Systems**: The ground systems of these antennas are often complex, with extensive radial ground systems to ensure efficient radiation at these low frequencies.

6. **Modulation and Coding**:
   - **Simple Modulation Schemes**: Because of the narrow bandwidth, simple modulation schemes are often used to transmit data, such as on-off keying or phase-shift keying.
   - **Error Correction**: Some form of error correction coding might be used to mitigate the effects of noise and interference on the transmitted signals.

Understanding these propagation characteristics is crucial for designing receivers and navigation algorithms that can effectively use the Alpha system for navigation and communication.

To find the wavelength, you can use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{c}{f}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength
- \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum (~299,792,458 meters per second or ~186,282 miles per second)
- \( f \) is the frequency in hertz

First, we can find the wavelength in meters:

\[
\lambda = \frac{299,792,458 \text{ m/s}}{11,900 \text{ Hz}} \approx 25,207.22 \text{ meters}
\]

Next, to find the wavelength in miles, we can use the speed of light in miles per second:

\[
\lambda = \frac{186,282 \text{ miles/s}}{11,900 \text{ Hz}} \approx 15.661 \text{ miles}
\]

So, the wavelength at 11.9 kHz is approximately 25,207.22 meters or about 15.661 miles.
